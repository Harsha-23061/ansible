⚙️ Ansible – End-to-End Concepts


📌 1. Introduction to Ansible

What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation and configuration management tool developed by Red Hat.
It allows you to automate provisioning, configuration, application deployment, orchestration, and IT infrastructure management using simple, human-readable YAML syntax.

Purpose & Benefits

Automate repetitive IT tasks

Improve consistency and reliability

Enable infrastructure as code (IaC)

Agentless — no software required on target nodes

Easy learning curve

⚙️ 2. Core Ansible Workflow

Ansible uses a push-based automation model with the following workflow:

Write – Define automation tasks in Playbooks (YAML files)

Inventory – Specify target nodes (hosts) to run tasks on

Execute – Run playbooks or ad-hoc commands from the control node

Report – Get results and logs of what changed

🧠 3. Ansible Architecture

Control Node – The system where Ansible is installed and commands are executed

Managed Nodes – Systems being managed (no agent required)

Inventory File – A list of target hosts grouped logically

Modules – Predefined units of work Ansible uses to perform tasks

Plugins – Extend Ansible’s core functionality (connection, callback, lookup, etc.)

Playbooks – YAML files that define desired states and tasks

Roles – Predefined structured way to organize playbooks

📂 4. Ansible Configuration Structure

ansible.cfg – Configuration file for default settings

Inventory – Defines target hosts (INI, YAML, or dynamic)

Playbooks – Contain plays (set of tasks mapped to hosts)

Tasks – Actions to be performed (using modules)

Handlers – Triggered only on change events

Variables – Parameterize playbooks for flexibility

Roles – Organize tasks, variables, templates, and handlers in reusable units

📁 5. Inventory Management

Purpose – Define and group target systems.

Types:

Static Inventory – Defined manually (INI or YAML format)

Dynamic Inventory – Generated via scripts or plugins (for cloud environments)

Groups – Logical sets of hosts for targeting specific environments (e.g., dev, prod)

📜 6. Playbooks

Definition – YAML-based files describing what actions should be performed on which hosts.

Key Concepts:

Consist of one or more plays

Each play targets a group of hosts and defines multiple tasks

Tasks call modules to perform actions

Benefits:

Declarative, idempotent, and reusable

🧩 7. Roles

Purpose – Provide a standard structure to organize reusable Ansible content.

Structure Components:

tasks, handlers, vars, defaults, templates, files, meta

Benefits:

Easier maintenance

Better collaboration

Promotes modularity

⚡ 8. Ansible Modules

Definition – Predefined code units that execute specific tasks.

Types of Modules:

System modules (users, packages, services)

Cloud modules (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, etc.)

Network modules

Database modules

Idempotency – Modules make changes only when needed.

💡 9. Variables & Facts

Variables

Parameterize configurations

Can be defined in playbooks, inventory, roles, or passed at runtime

Facts

Automatically gathered system information from managed nodes

Used for conditional logic and templating

🧮 10. Conditionals, Loops & Handlers

Conditionals – Execute tasks based on conditions (if statements)
Loops – Repeat tasks over a list of items (looping structures)
Handlers – Triggered only when notified (on change), useful for services restart

🛡️ 11. Ansible Vault

Purpose – Encrypt sensitive data such as passwords, keys, or secrets.
Use Cases

Secure credentials in playbooks or variable files

Encrypt entire files or specific variables
Supports password or key-based encryption

🧠 12. Ansible Facts and Templates

Facts – Collected from managed nodes to use as variables

Templates – Use Jinja2 templating to generate dynamic configuration files

🔁 13. Execution Order & Idempotency

Ansible executes tasks top to bottom within a play

Tasks run host by host

Idempotent: Running the same play multiple times will not change anything unless required

☁️ 14. Cloud Automation with Ansible

Integration with Cloud Providers

Supports managing infrastructure on major clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, VMware, etc.

Often used with Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform for provisioning + configuration

📊 15. Ansible Tower / AWX

Ansible Tower (by Red Hat) and AWX (open-source version):

Web-based UI for Ansible

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Centralized logging and scheduling

REST APIs for integration

🖥️ 16. Ansible CLI (Conceptual Commands)

ansible – Run ad-hoc commands on hosts

ansible-playbook – Execute playbooks

ansible-inventory – View/manage inventory

ansible-doc – Show module documentation

ansible-vault – Encrypt/decrypt secrets

(You don’t need syntax here, just understand their purpose)

💡 17. Ansible Best Practices

Use roles for structure and reuse

Maintain separate inventory for environments

Use version control (Git) for playbooks

Secure secrets with Ansible Vault

Test playbooks in staging before production

Write idempotent tasks

⚠️ 18. Ansible Limitations

Not designed for infrastructure provisioning at scale (use Terraform for that)

Can be slow for very large infrastructures (push-based)

Requires SSH access to all nodes

Less suitable for Windows environments compared to Linux

✅ Summary

Ansible is a simple, agentless automation platform that lets you configure, deploy, and manage systems at scale.
By using inventory, playbooks, roles, variables, modules, and vault, you can automate infrastructure consistently and securely.
It complements tools like Terraform by focusing on configuration while Terraform handles provisioning.
